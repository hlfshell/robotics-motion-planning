# Robotics Computational Motion Planning
Coursera Robotics Specialization - Robotics Computational Motion Planning 

This is my github repository for work performed to complete the Robotics Computational Motion Planning Course in the UPenn Robotics Specialization courses on Coursera.

The course was 4 weeks long, and is broken down as such within the repository.
